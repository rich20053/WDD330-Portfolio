        <h4>Master Mobil UX</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Mobile First - easier to build small and make bigger than the other way around</li>
          <li>Mobile first sometimes requires a mindset change</li>
          <li>Doing otherwise is like trying to put a marshmallow in a piggy bank</li>
          <li>Mobile devices are proliferating quickly - this is not a fad</li>
          <li>Three things you can do to make a difference:
            <ol>
              <li>Be There - to help move someone along their decision journey</li>
              <li>Be Useful - satify their needs - provide them with what they came for as quickly as possible</li>
              <li>Be Quick - They should not notice how quick it is</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Design so that actions are easily reachable with the user's thumb
          <li>Networks matter</li>
          <li>Speed matters
            <ul>
              <li>Reduce image usage throughout sites/apps</li>
              <li>SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwidth</li>
              <li>Optimize and minify CSS and JS files</li>
              <li>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Software is mediocre - we make do</li>
          <li>Placement matters - menu at bottom?</li>
          <li>Reachability produces perception of speed improvement</li>
          <li>Strive for "amazing" rather than settling for "good enough"</li>
          <li>"Menu" in a button produced better user understanding</li>
          <li>Mobile is a great forcing function for simplicity</li>
          <li>Mobile Forms
            <ul>
              <li>Save space by putting labels inside input</li>
              <li>Use float labels to keep a small version of the label above the entry</li>
              <li>Make boxes larger to make them easier to hit with the thumb, including checkboxes, etc.</li>
              <li>Only include what is actually needed so that the fields do not go beyond the screen</li>
              <li>Only display fields as user identifies the information needed, like contact method</li>
              <li>Label should identify what information is needed, less generic</li>
              <li>Enable "Autocomplete"</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Passwords Matter
            <ul>
              <li>Have a forgot password link</li>
              <li>Show passwords, but have a button to hide, if needed. Hiding the password hides typos and can cause frustration.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Credit Card information
            <ul>
              <li>Use auto complete</li>
              <li>Use good spacing and auto advanced</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Always provide the best keyboard for the information they are entering</li>
          <li>Use a big key keypad, when possible</li>
          <li>Link phone numbers so that a click will initiate calls</li>
          <li>Advertising is competing for space</li>
          <li>Make ads small and simple</li>
          <li>Allow expansion on click</li>
          <li>Small add at bottom with a window to the ad behind the content
          <li>Stop using pop ups and pop overs</li>
          <li>Remember that users do not visit your website for the advertisements</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Is localStorage a popular way to persist data in real world
            applications? Or is it just a work around when we don't want to deal
            with sessions, or even an actual database?  
            I think this question in the example is a good one.  
            I think you want to use local storage when the data is not 
            important to you and your website, but may be important to the user.
