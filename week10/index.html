        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <h4>Client-Side Form Validation</h4>
        <p>I did a project on this in a previous class.  You can 
          view my prentation by clicking on the link in the list above. 
          I have used most of them at one time or another. However, I 
          have never used the Constraint Validation API. I will see if there
          is a way to use it in my project.
        </p>
        <h4>Using the Fetch API</h4>
        <p>I have used some of these before, but I have never used the data- 
          attribute. I enjoyed using it for the team activity.  I expect
          that I will find other opportunites. It seems like a very useful
          feature.
        </p>
        <h4>Quakes Near Me/Team activity</h4>
        <p>This was another great exercise.  I spent most of my time debugging
          the mistakes I made.  However, I learned something from each one.
        </p>
        <h4>Challenge 2</h4>
        <p>I have begun my work on the project.
