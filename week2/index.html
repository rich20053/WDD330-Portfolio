        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 2 - Programming Basics</h4>
        <p>This was a good review.  The Symbol type is new to me. 
          I am not sure I fully understand how to use it.  
          It appears to be very conceptual.  It seems like it is some 
          unique value that cannot be seen. It appears to only display 
          the text that describes it.</p>
        <h4>Chapter 3 - Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h4>
        <p>This was another good review.  Weak sets and weak maps is new to me. 
          It appears that this is a way to make sure that there are no memory 
          leaks when references are part of the set or map.  
          I have never used this.  To use it you will have to know whether you 
          will have references in the set or map.</p>
        <h4>Chapter 4 - Functions</h4>
        <p>This was another good review that reminded me of some great 
           features.  Callbacks can be extremely helpful in certain situations.
           I will be on the lookout for those opportunities.</p>
        <h4>Team Assignment</h4>
        <p>After working with the team, I made some changes to the team code to 
          add some callbacks.  It took some time to figure out how to use it, 
          but it was worth the effort. Check out the code for the team activity
          event.  
        </p>

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p> Arrow functions and Callbacks are very cool, 
            but they remind me of abbreviations and acronyms when writing.
            While they are quick and may save space, it is not always clear 
            what they mean. This may increase any maintenance effort.
            Should you always use them or are there times when it makes more sense
            to be more verbose, but also more clear? </p>
