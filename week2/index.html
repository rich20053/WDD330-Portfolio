        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 2 - Programming Basics</h4>
        <p>This was a good review.  The Symbol type is new to me. 
          I am not sure I fully understand how to use it.  
          It appears to be very conceptual.  It seems like it is some 
          unique value that cannot be seen. It appears to only display 
          the text that describes it.</p>
        <h4>Chapter 3 - Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h4>
        <p>This was another good review.  Weak sets and weak maps is new to me. 
          It appears that this is a way to make sure that there are no memory 
          leaks when references are part of the set or map.  
          I have never used this.  To use it you will have to know whether you 
          will have references in the set or map.</p>
        <h4>Chapter 4 - Functions</h4>
        <p>This was another good review that reminded me of some great 
          features.  Callbacks can be extremely helpful in certain situations.
          I will be on the lookout for those opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <!--
        <ol>
          <li>
            Is localStorage a popular way to persist data in real world
            applications? Or is it just a work around when we don't want to deal
            with sessions, or even an actual database?  
            I think this question in the example is a good one.  
            I think you want to use local storage when the data is not 
            important to you and your website, but may be important to the user.
