        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 5 - Objects</h4>
        <p>Although I have plenty of experience with objects, 
            this chapter brought something to my mind that I had
            never considered before. I have never considered that 
            an object is like a map!</p>
        <p>I really like the 'for' capability and methods that show 
            the keys and the values of the object.</p>
        <p>The abilty to change properties to an object on the fly is fascinating.</p>
        <h4>Chapter 6 - Document Object Model</h4>
        <p>This was another good review.  ap.</p>
        <h4>Chapter 7 - Events</h4>
        <p>This was another good review that reminded me of some great 
           features.  ies.</p>
        <h4>Team Activity</h4>
        <p>I recently auditioned for "Savior of the World" and got a part.
          I had a rehearsal on the night of the team meeting and missed out.
          It as truly affected my learning and understanding of the material.
          Fortunately, none of the other rehearsals or performances are on Wednesday
          night, so I should have no more conflicts.

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p> I am struggling a little with Symbols.  What exactly is a Symbol? 
            Is is simply a variable that holds a guaranteed unique value?
            It is not an integer, string, or decimal, but a generic value, right?
            Based on what I am reading, its best use is as an index. 
            Would you agree?
