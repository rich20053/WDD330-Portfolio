        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 5 - Objects</h4>
        <p>Although I have plenty of experience with objects, 
            this chapter brought something to my mind that I had
            never considered before. I have never considered that 
            an object is like a map!</p>
        <h4>Chapter 6 - Document Object Model</h4>
        <p>This was another good review.  ap.</p>
        <h4>Chapter 7 - Events</h4>
        <p>This was another good review that reminded me of some great 
           features.  ies.</p>
        <h4>Team Activity</h4>
        <p>After working with the team, I made some changes to the team code to 
          add some callbacks.  
        </p>

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p> Arrow functions and Callbacks are very cool, 
            but they remind me of abbreviations and acronyms when writing.
            While they are quick and may save space, it is not always clear 
            what they mean. This may increase any maintenance effort.
            Should you always use them or are there times when it makes more sense
            to be more verbose, but also more clear? </p>
