        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 8 - Forms</h4>
        <p>Form events I need to use more... focus, blur, change, submit </p>
        <p>Use events to change the form values.</p>
        <p>Use Javascript to change form attributes.</p>
        <p>Using name attribut to processing checkboxes using an array/iterators. (filter/map)</p>
        <p>Use Javascript to validate form data and to display validation messages.</p>
        <p>Use Javascript to disable the submit button when validation errors occur.</p>
        <h4>Chapter 12 - Object Oriented Programming</h4>
        <p>I know quite bit about the Object Oriented Programming, but again 
          I found the detail in this chapter to be very useful.</p>
        <p>The idea that an object is like a map comes into play here, as in 
          adding attributes and methods to built in objects.</p>
          <p>New Concepts to me:</p>
        <p>Property descriptors</p>
        <p>Object prototyping</p>
        <p>Mixins</p>
        <h4>Chapter 15 - Modern Javascript</h4>
        <p>This is almost entirely new to me. I will have to do a lot more
          research of the various libraries to see what might be the most valuable.
          I have used MVC and templates, but I was especially impressed with the 
          various methods of optimization. Great stuff!</p>
        <h4>Team Activity</h4>
        <p>I enjoyed the opportunity to use listeners and element arrays. 
          It was very instructive.</p>

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p> I am wondering about the idea of prototyping.  
          It seems like, although useful in certain situations, it could be quite confusing.
          What do you think?  Have you used them before? 
          I am wondering the same thing about mixins.
