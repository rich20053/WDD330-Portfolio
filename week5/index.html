        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 10 - Testing and Debugging</h4>
        <p>Use of "use strict" could be very helpful in improving my code. 
          Linting tools might also be helpful. I have used them before, 
          but not this semester.</p>
        <p>Feature detection will be helpful when addressing older browers.</p>
        <p>I have lots of experience debugging using the browser.</p>
        <p>I also have lots of experience with error handling. However, I am 
          not sure I have ever used a "finally" block. I should try that sometime.     </p>
        <p>Setting up the test first and test harnesses are good.  
          I have used them in the past for work assignments, 
          but they seem like overkill for school assignments. 
          If you know your code will last more than a week or two, it is worth 
          the time because you will always need to retest. School assignment time 
          limitations and short term use means there is less return for the effort.</p>
        <h4>Team Activity</h4>
        <p>This assignment was a little more challenging.  It was more difficult to decide
          as a team how to llllllllllll

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p> I am wondering what you think about my thoughts on test harnesses 
          in the notes section. I think they can be very effective to long-term
          projects, but not very effective for short school assignments or 
          for small javascript functions. What do you think?  
          Have you used them before?</p>
