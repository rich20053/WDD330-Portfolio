        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 11 - Further Functions</h4>
        <p>I found the idea of a function that defines and rewrites itself to be fascinating.
          It seems like it could be a very useful funciton. I will be on the lookout for 
          and opportunity to use it.
        </p>
        <p>I have used recursive functions and callbacks before, but this is the first 
          I have learned of closures.  I am not sure I will be able to find an opportunity
          to use this, but I will be thinking about it.
        </p>
        <h4>Chapter 13 - AJAX</h4>
        <p>I have used this a little in the past, but this has helped me understand it
          better.  I expect I will get to know it better when I am taking a back end class.</p>
        <h4>Team Activity</h4>
        <p>This assignment was a nice combination of the hiking and the todo assignments.
          Somehow we are never able to get to the stretch part of the assignment.  I suspect 
          it is because we are not able to quickly arrive at a decision when we are deciding 
          how to develop the solution. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p> While I am interested finding a place where I could use closures, I am equally
          concerned about using them.  I have a concern that I might easily become confused 
          about what variable hold what values.  Have you ever used closures?  Did you 
        ever have any issues knowing the variable contents?</p>
