        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 8 - Transforms and Transitions</h4>
        <p>Transforms and transitions are always a fun subject. 
          I have used it many times in the past.  For practice, 
          I added a starfighter to my SWAPI page.
        </p>
        <h4>Chapter 12 - Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h4>
        <p>I have used Canvas and SVG before, but I have never used Drag and Drop before.
          I will be looking for an opportunity to use it. I added some SVG I have done 
          in the past to my portfolio events. It is not new, but I thought it was a 
          good example of my knowledge and I did not have time to do anything new.
          Maybe in a different week.
        </p>
        <h4>Team Activity</h4>
        <p>This assignment provided good practice in use of AJAX. I had no trouble 
          understanding or applying the principles.  I enjoyed playing with it.
