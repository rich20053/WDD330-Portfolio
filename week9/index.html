        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 9 - The Window Object</h4>
        <p>Lots of interesting functionality is available.  I am not sure
          when I would use any of these, but they could come in handy some
          day.  It was interesting to get a better understanding of how cookies
          function.
        </p>
        <h4>Chapter 14 - HTML5 APIs</h4>
        <p>I have used some of these before, but I have never used the data- 
          attribute. I enjoyed using it for the team activity.  I expect
          that I will find other opportunites. It seems like a very useful
          feature.
        </p>
        <h4>Managing work flows</h4>
        <p>This was an interesting exercise.  The install failed and I was never able
          to get it to work properly. I think this is a good approach if you are in 
          a company development environment.  Hopefully, the compay already has 
          a migration process that is automated in some way.
        </p>
        <h4>Team Activity</h4>
        <p>This assignment was very enjoyable. It was challenging and it gave 
          me good experience in the use of audio and the data- attribute.

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p>Cookies still seem to be widely used. Is there a reason that 
          people have not switched to localStorage?
